/*
 * Programming Quiz: Quidditch Cup (6-5)
 */

In the Harry Potter novels, children attending the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry belong to one of four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Each year, the houses assemble a Quidditch team of seven players to compete for the coveted Quidditch Cup.

Consider the following array.

var team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
Directions:
Create a function called hasEnoughPlayers() that takes the team array as an argument and returns true or false depending on if the array has at least seven players.

// your code goes here
function hasEnoughPlayers(team) {
    if (team.length >= 7) {
        return true
    } else {
        return false
    }
}

var falseTest = ["Chad"]
var team = ["Oliver Wood", "Angelina Johnson", "Katie Bell", "Alicia Spinnet", "George Weasley", "Fred Weasley", "Harry Potter"];
console.log(hasEnoughPlayers(team));
console.log(hasEnoughPlayers(falseTest));

/*
 * Programming Quiz: Joining the Crew (6-6)
 */

Directions:
In an earlier exercise, you created a crew array to represent Malâ€™s crew from the hit show Firefly.

var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";

var crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];
Later in the show, Mal takes on three new crew members named "Simon", "River", and "Book". Use the push() method to add the three new crew members to the crew array.

var doctor = "Simon";
var sister = "River";
var shepherd = "Book";


var captain = "Mal";
var second = "Zoe";
var pilot = "Wash";
var companion = "Inara";
var mercenary = "Jayne";
var mechanic = "Kaylee";

var crew = [captain, second, pilot, companion, mercenary, mechanic];

var doctor = "Simon";
var sister = "River";
var shepherd = "Book";

crew.push(doctor, sister, shepherd)

console.log(crew)
// your code goes here


/*
 * Programming Quiz: Another Type of Loop (6-8)
 *
 * Use the existing `test` variable and write a `forEach` loop
 * that adds 100 to each number that is divisible by 3.
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - you must use an `if` statement to verify code is divisible by 3
 *  - you can use `console.log` to verify the `test` variable when you're finished looping
 */

var test = [12, 929, 11, 3, 199, 1000, 7, 1, 24, 37, 4,
    19, 300, 3775, 299, 36, 209, 148, 169, 299,
    6, 109, 20, 58, 139, 59, 3, 1, 139
];

// Write your code here

test.forEach(function(number,index) {
    if (number % 3 === 0) {
        number += 100;
        test[index] = number;
    }
});

console.log(test[0]);
